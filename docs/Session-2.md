# Session 2: Coding Tools: Your Magic Wand! 🛠️

## 🎯 Session Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:

1. **Install and Set Up Your Coding Environment:** Learn how to install Visual Studio Code and set it up for your web development projects.
2. **Run Your First HTML File:** Create and open your very first HTML file to see how it works.
3. **Understand Basic HTML Structure:** Get familiar with the basic structure of an HTML document.

## 🛠️ What You’ll Need

1. **A Computer:** Make sure you have a computer with internet access.
2. **Visual Studio Code:** A popular code editor that we will use for writing our code.
3. **A Web Browser:** To view the web pages you create.

## 🚀 Let’s Get Started!

### 1. Installing Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

First things first, let’s get our coding tools ready!

1. **Download Visual Studio Code:**
   - Open your web browser and go to [Visual Studio Code's download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - Click on the download button that matches your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Install Visual Studio Code:**
   - Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system. If you’re unsure, ask for help or look up a guide online.

3. **Open Visual Studio Code:**
   - Once installed, open Visual Studio Code. You should see a welcome screen with options to open a folder, create a new file, or open an existing file.

### 2. Creating Your First HTML File

Now that you have Visual Studio Code ready, let’s create your first HTML file!

1. **Create a New File:**
   - In Visual Studio Code, go to the top menu and select **File** > **New File**. Alternatively, you can press `Ctrl + N` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + N` (macOS).

2. **Save the File:**
   - Save the new file by going to **File** > **Save As**. Name your file `index.html`. The `.html` extension is very important because it tells the computer that this is an HTML file.

3. **Write Your First HTML Code:**
   - Type the following code into your `index.html` file:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
       <head>
         <title>My First Web Page</title>
       </head>
       <body>
         <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
         <p>This is my first web page using HTML.</p>
       </body>
     </html>
     ```
   - This code sets up a basic HTML document structure. Let’s break it down:
     - `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.
     - `<html>`: This is the root element of an HTML page.
     - `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, like the title.
     - `<title>`: The title of the web page that appears in the browser tab.
     - `<body>`: The main content of the web page.
     - `<h1>`: A heading element (largest size).
     - `<p>`: A paragraph element.

4. **Save Your Work:**
   - Save the changes by pressing `Ctrl + S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + S` (macOS).

### 3. Viewing Your Web Page

Let’s see how your code looks in a web browser!

1. **Open the File in a Browser:**
   - Find the `index.html` file you just saved.
   - Right-click on the file and select **Open With** > **Choose Your Browser** (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

2. **See the Results:**
   - Your web browser will display the web page you created. You should see "Hello, World!" as a heading and a paragraph saying "This is my first web page using HTML."

### 4. Interactive Activity: HTML Elements Hunt 🕵️‍♂️

Let’s make it fun and interactive! Follow these steps to explore more HTML elements:

1. **Add More HTML Elements:**
   - Go back to your `index.html` file and add the following elements inside the `<body>` section:
     ```html
     <h2>My Favorite Animals</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Dogs</li>
       <li>Cats</li>
       <li>Horses</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Here is a list of some of my favorite animals!</p>
     ```

2. **Save and Refresh:**
   - Save your changes and refresh the browser page to see your updated content.

3. **HTML Element Hunt:**
   - Find out what each element does:
     - `<h2>`: A smaller heading.
     - `<ul>`: An unordered list (bulleted list).
     - `<li>`: A list item.
     - `<p>`: A paragraph.
   - Try adding more elements and experiment with their positions and content.

### 5. Code Challenge: Create Your Own Greeting Page! 🎨

Now it’s your turn to get creative!

1. **Create a New HTML Page:**
   - In Visual Studio Code, create a new file and save it as `greeting.html`.

2. **Design Your Page:**
   - Add a greeting message like “Welcome to My Awesome Page!”
   - Include a list of your favorite things or hobbies.
   - Use at least one heading and one paragraph.

3. **Open and View:**
   - Open `greeting.html` in your browser to see your creation.
