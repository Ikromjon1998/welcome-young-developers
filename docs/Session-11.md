# üåü Session 11: HTML Tables - Organizing Information! üìä

Welcome back, young coders! Today, we‚Äôre going to learn about HTML tables, which are fantastic for organizing and displaying information on your website. Ready to create tables that will make your data look neat and easy to read? Let‚Äôs get started!

## üéØ **Learning Goals for Today**

By the end of this session, you will:
1. Understand the structure and purpose of HTML tables.
2. Be able to create a simple HTML table to display data.
3. Style your table using CSS to make it look great.

## üìñ **Introduction to HTML Tables**

### **What is an HTML Table?**

An HTML table is a way to organize data into rows and columns, just like the grids in a spreadsheet. It‚Äôs perfect for displaying information such as schedules, scores, or lists in a clear and structured way.

### **Key Concepts of HTML Tables**

- **`<table>`**: The container for the whole table.
- **`<tr>`**: Table rows where each row represents a horizontal line of cells.
- **`<th>`**: Table headers which are bold and centered by default.
- **`<td>`**: Table data cells where the actual data goes.

## üîç **Exploring HTML Tables**

### **1. Table Structure**

- **Explanation**: Tables are created using a series of rows and columns. Each row is defined with `<tr>`, and inside each row, you place header cells (`<th>`) or data cells (`<td>`).

- **Example**:

  ```html
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
      <th>Grade</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Alice</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bob</td>
      <td>13</td>
      <td>B</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  ```

### **2. Adding Borders and Spacing**

- **Explanation**: You can add borders to your table to make it more readable. The `border` attribute can be used directly in the HTML tag or styled using CSS.

- **Example**:

  ```html
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Book Title</th>
      <th>Author</th>
      <th>Year</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The Hobbit</td>
      <td>J.R.R. Tolkien</td>
      <td>1937</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1984</td>
      <td>George Orwell</td>
      <td>1949</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  ```

## üíª **Interactive Coding Activity: Create Your Favorite Books Table**

1. Open your HTML file in your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
2. Ensure your file has a basic HTML structure with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

### **2. Write Your Table Code**

Follow these steps to create a table that lists your favorite books:

1. **Step 1**: Add the table tag and header row:

    ```html
    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>Book Title</th>
        <th>Author</th>
        <th>Publication Year</th>
      </tr>
    ```

2. **Step 2**: Add data rows with your favorite books:

    ```html
      <tr>
        <td>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</td>

        <td>J.R.R. Tolkien</td>
        <td>1937</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Hands-On Project: Create a Data Table for a School Project**

In this project, you‚Äôll build a table that displays data for a school project using the HTML skills you‚Äôve learned today.

### **Project Steps:**

1. **Create a NEW HTML File:** Name it `school-project.html`.
2. **Add Your Basic HTML Structure:**

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>School Project</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>My School Project</h1>
      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <th>Subject</th>
          <th>Teacher</th>
          <th>Room Number</th>
        </tr>
        <!-- Add your rows here -->
      </table>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

3. **Add Your Table Data:** Fill in the rows with data relevant to your school project.

4. **Style Your Table:** Open your CSS file or add a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML to add custom styles.

    ```css
    table {
      width: 100%;
      border-collapse: collapse;
    }

    th, td {
      padding: 10px;
      text-align: left;
      border: 1px solid #ddd;
    }

    th {
      background-color: #f2f2f2;
    }

    tr:nth-child(even) {
      background-color: #f9f9f9;
    }

    tr:hover {
      background-color: #f1f1f1;
    }
    ```

5. **Save and Preview:** Save your file and open it in a web browser to see your styled table.
