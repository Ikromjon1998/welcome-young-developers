## Session 3: GitHub Pages: Your Website's Home! 🏠

### What's GitHub Pages? 🤔

Imagine GitHub Pages as a cool online neighborhood where your website can live. It's a free place provided by GitHub where you can share your amazing creations with the world!

### Why Use GitHub Pages? ✨

* **Easy to Use:**  You don't need to be a computer whiz to use it.
* **Free Hosting:**  No need to worry about paying for a website home.
* **Learn and Share:**  A great way to share your projects with friends, family, and even future employers!

### Setting Up Your GitHub Account 🔑

1. **Ask a Grown-Up:** Have a parent or guardian help you create a free GitHub account. 
2. **Choose a Username:** Pick a cool name that represents you (or your website).
3. **Create a Repository:** This is like a folder where your website files will live. Name it `yourusername.github.io`.

### Building Your First Website with GitHub Pages 🚀

1. **Hello World!**  
   * Create a new file called `index.html` in your repository.
   * Inside the file, type:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>My Awesome Website</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
       <p>This is my first website!</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. **Commit Your Changes:** Think of this like saving your work, but for code!
3. **Publish Your Website:** GitHub Pages will automatically make your website live at `yourusername.github.io`.

### Activity Time! 🎉

Let's make our websites a bit more interesting!

1. **Add More Content:** Use HTML tags you learned in the last session to add paragraphs, headings, and lists to your website.
2. **Personalize It:** Tell the world about yourself, your hobbies, or anything you like!
3. **Share:** Show off your website to a friend or family member!

### Bonus Challenge 🧠

Can you figure out how to add an image to your website? (Hint: Look up "HTML image tag" on the internet.)

### Remember:

* GitHub Pages is a powerful tool for new web developers.
* Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things!
* Have fun building your online home! 😊
