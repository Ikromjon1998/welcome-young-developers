**Duration:** 10 minutes

2. **Visualization:** Show an example of a simple "Favorite Things" webpage. Point out how pictures, headings, and descriptions can come together to tell a story about the topic.

### **2. Setting Up Your Project** üõ†Ô∏è

**Duration:** 5 minutes

**Instructions:**

1. **Create a New File:**
   - Open Visual Studio Code (or your preferred code editor).
   - Create a new folder called `FavoriteThingsPage`.
   - Inside this folder, create two files: `index.html` and `styles.css`.

2. **Basic HTML Structure:**
   - Open `index.html` and add the basic HTML boilerplate:

     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>My Favorite Things</title>
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
     </head>
     <body>
         <header>
             <h1>My Favorite Things</h1>
         </header>
         <main>
             <!-- Your favorite things will go here -->
         </main>
         <footer>
             <p>Created by [Your Name]</p>
         </footer>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

   - In `styles.css`, start with some basic styling:

     ```css
     body {
         font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
         line-height: 1.6;
         margin: 0;
         padding: 0;
     }

     header, footer {
         background-color: #f4f4f4;
         padding: 10px 0;
         text-align: center;
     }

     main {
         padding: 20px;
     }

     .favorite-item {
         margin-bottom: 20px;
     }

     .favorite-item img {
         width: 100px;
         height: auto;
         display: block;
         margin-bottom: 10px;
     }
     ```

### **3. Creating Your Favorite Things Page** ‚úèÔ∏è

**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Instructions:**

1. **Add Content to `index.html`:**

   - Inside the `<main>` section, you‚Äôll add a few favorite things. Here‚Äôs an example to guide you:

     ```html
     <main>
         <section class="favorite-item">
             <h2>My Favorite Book</h2>
             <img src="book.jpg" alt="Favorite Book">
             <p>This is a great book because...</p>
         </section>
         <section class="favorite-item">
             <h2>My Favorite Game</h2>
             <img src="game.jpg" alt="Favorite Game">
             <p>This game is amazing because...</p>
         </section>
         <!-- Add more favorite things as you like -->
     </main>
     ```

   - **Note:** Replace `book.jpg` and `game.jpg` with images related to the favorite things you choose. You can use placeholder images from the internet or draw your own.

2. **Style Your Content in `styles.css`:**

   - Enhance the appearance of your favorite things:

     ```css
     .favorite-item {
         border: 2px solid #ddd;
         border-radius: 8px;
         padding: 10px;
         background-color: #f9f9f9;
     }

     .favorite-item h2 {
         color: #333;
     }

     .favorite-item img {
         border-radius: 8px;
     }

     footer p {
         margin: 0;
         color: #666;
     }
     ```

   - Discuss with the students how different CSS properties (like border, padding, and colors) change the appearance of their page.
