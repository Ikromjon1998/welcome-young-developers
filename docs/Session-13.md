# üåü Session 13: JavaScript - The Web's Magician! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Welcome back, young coders! Today, we‚Äôre diving into the magical world of JavaScript. JavaScript is the programming language that makes websites interactive and fun. Ready to add some magic to your web pages? Let‚Äôs get started!

## üéØ **Learning Goals for Today**

By the end of this session, you will:
1. Understand what JavaScript is and how it enhances web pages.
2. Learn how to add JavaScript to your HTML files.
3. Write your first JavaScript code to make your website interactive.

## üìñ **Introduction to JavaScript**

### **What is JavaScript?**

JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic and interactive effects on websites. It can update content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more. Think of it as the magic wand that brings your web pages to life!

### **Key Concepts of JavaScript**

- **Scripts**: JavaScript code written in scripts that run in the browser.
- **Variables**: Containers for storing data values.
- **Functions**: Blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be reused.
- **Events**: Actions that trigger JavaScript code, like clicking a button or typing in a text field.

## üîç **Exploring JavaScript**

### **1. Adding JavaScript to HTML**

- **Explanation**: You can add JavaScript to your HTML document using the `<script>` tag. This tag can be placed in the `<head>` or at the end of the `<body>` section.

- **Example**:

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
    <script>
      // This is a comment in JavaScript
      function greet() {
        alert('Hello, welcome to my website!');
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button onclick="greet()">Click Me!</button>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

### **2. Understanding Variables and Functions**

- **Explanation**: Variables store data, and functions perform actions. You can define a function and call it to execute its code.

- **Example**:

  ```html
  <script>
    let userName = 'Alice'; // This is a variable

    function sayHello() {
      alert('Hello, ' + userName + '!');
    }
  </script>
  ```

  - In this example, `userName` is a variable holding a string, and `sayHello` is a function that displays a greeting.

## üíª **Interactive Coding Activity: Your First JavaScript Program**

### **1. Set Up Your Coding Environment**

1. Open a new HTML file in your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
2. Ensure your file has a basic HTML structure with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

### **2. Write Your JavaScript Code**

Follow these steps to create a simple JavaScript program:

1. **Step 1**: Add a JavaScript function to display a greeting:

    ```html
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>My First JavaScript</title>
      <script>
        function displayMessage() {
          alert('JavaScript is awesome!');
        }
      </script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <button onclick="displayMessage()">Show Message</button>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

2. **Save and Open Your File**:

    - Save your HTML file and open it in your web browser to see your JavaScript in action.

### **3. Experiment with Your Own Code**

Try modifying the code to make the message say something different or add more buttons with different messages.

- **Challenge**: Create a button that changes the text of a paragraph when clicked.

    ```html
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>JavaScript Challenge</title>
      <script>
        function changeText() {
          document.getElementById('myText').innerText = 'Text has been changed!';
        }
      </script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <p id="myText">Original text.</p>
      <button onclick="changeText()">Change Text</button>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

2. **How do you define a variable in JavaScript?**
    - a) `variable name`
    - b) `var name`

3. a) Displays a message box with a specified message - The `alert` function shows a pop-up box with a message.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Hands-On Project: Interactive Greeting**

In this project, you‚Äôll create a web page that greets visitors by name using JavaScript.

### **Project Steps:**

1. **Create a NEW HTML File:** Name it `greeting.html`.
2. **Add Your Basic HTML Structure:**

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>Interactive Greeting</title>
      <script>
        function greetVisitor() {
          let visitorName = prompt('What is your name?');
          alert('Hello, ' + visitorName + '! Welcome to my website.');
        }
      </script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <button onclick="greetVisitor()">Greet Me!</button>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

3. **Save and Preview:** Save your file and open it in a web browser to test your interactive greeting.

## ‚ú® **Wrap-Up and Homework**

You did an amazing job today! To reinforce what you've learned:

- **Homework:** Create a web page with at least three different JavaScript functions that interact with the user.
- **Additional Practice:** Explore more JavaScript functions and try combining them to create more complex interactions.

## üöÄ **Fun Fact!**

Did you know that JavaScript was originally created in just 10 days by Brendan Eich in 1995? It‚Äôs now one of the most popular programming languages in the world!

Great work today! Keep experimenting and see you next time!

Happy Coding! üíª‚ú®
