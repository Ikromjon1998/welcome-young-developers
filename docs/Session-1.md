### Session Outline:

1. **Introduction and Icebreaker (10 minutes)**
    - Welcome students and introduce yourself.
    - Icebreaker activity: "My Favorite Website" - Have each student share their favorite website and why they like it.

2. **Exploring the Web (10 minutes)**
    - Briefly discuss what the internet is and how it connects people around the world.
    - Show some popular websites (Google, YouTube, etc.) and discuss their purposes.

3. **How the Web Works (15 minutes)**
    - Explain the basic concepts of servers, browsers, and URLs in a fun and simple way:
        - **Servers**: The places where websites live.
        - **Browsers**: The tools we use to visit these websites.
        - **URLs**: The addresses we use to find websites.
    - Use visuals and animations to make the concepts more engaging.
    - Activity: Draw and label a simple diagram showing how a browser requests a page from a server and displays it.

4. **Interactive Activity: Web Scavenger Hunt (15 minutes)**
    - Divide students into small groups.
    - Give each group a list of tasks to complete online (e.g., find a website with a cat picture, locate a news website, find an educational game site).
    - Encourage students to discuss and share what they find.

5. **Introduction to the Course (10 minutes)**
    - Outline what the students will learn in the course: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics.
    - Share the course goals: By the end of the course, they will have created their own website.
    - Set expectations for behavior, participation, and homework.

6. **Wrap-Up and Q&A (5 minutes)**
    - Summarize the main points of the session.
    - Answer any questions the students might have.
    - Give a sneak peek into the next session: Setting up their coding environment.

### Detailed Content:

#### 1. Introduction and Icebreaker (10 minutes)
Welcome students with enthusiasm and energy. Introduce yourself and share a little about your background in web development and why you love it.

**Icebreaker Activity: "My Favorite Website"**
- Have each student stand up, say their name, and share their favorite website and why they like it. 
- This helps students to get to know each other and also sparks curiosity about different types of websites.

#### 2. Exploring the Web (10 minutes)
**What is the Internet?**
- The internet is a global network connecting millions of computers. It allows people to share information and communicate with each other.

**Popular Websites**
- Show examples of popular websites:
  - **Google**: A search engine that helps you find information on the internet.
  - **YouTube**: A video-sharing platform where people can watch and upload videos.
  - **Wikipedia**: An online encyclopedia with information on almost every topic.
  - **National Geographic Kids**: An educational site with fun facts and games about nature and science.

**Discussion Questions:**
- What do you use the internet for?
- How many websites do you think exist on the internet?

#### 3. How the Web Works (15 minutes)
**Basic Concepts:**
- **Servers**: Imagine servers as big computers that store websites. When you want to visit a website, your computer asks the server for the information, and the server sends it back.
- **Browsers**: Browsers are like translators. They take the code from the server and turn it into something we can see and interact with on our screens. Examples: Chrome, Firefox, Safari.
- **URLs**: URLs are like street addresses for websites. Just like you need an address to find a friend’s house, you need a URL to find a website.

**Interactive Explanation:**
- Use visuals:
  - A picture of a server as a big computer.
  - A browser icon turning code into a webpage.
  - A URL as a signpost leading to a website.
- Draw a simple diagram on the board showing the process:
  1. Type a URL into the browser.
  2. The browser sends a request to the server.
  3. The server sends the website’s data back to the browser.
  4. The browser displays the website.

**Activity: Draw and Label Diagram**
- Give students paper and markers.
- Ask them to draw their own version of the diagram and label each part (browser, server, URL).

#### 4. Interactive Activity: Web Scavenger Hunt (15 minutes)
**Setting Up:**
- Divide the class into small groups (3-4 students per group).
- Hand out a list of tasks for the scavenger hunt.

**Example Tasks:**
- Find a website with a cat picture.
- Locate a website that has games you can play.
- Find a website where you can learn something new (like a science fact).
- Find a news website.

**Instructions:**
- Each group will use a computer to complete the tasks.
- They should write down the URLs of the websites they visit.
- Encourage them to discuss why they think the website is a good example for the task.

**Sharing Findings:**
- After 10 minutes, ask each group to share one or two websites they found and explain why they chose them.

#### 5. Introduction to the Course (10 minutes)
**Course Outline:**
- Explain that over the next 16 sessions, they will learn how to create their own websites using three main tools:
  - **HTML**: The structure of the website.
  - **CSS**: The style and design.
  - **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity and fun features.

**Course Goals:**
- By the end of the course, each student will have created their own website that they can share with friends and family.

**Setting Expectations:**
- Encourage active participation and questions.
- Set rules for respectful behavior and teamwork.
- Explain that there will be some homework to practice what they learn.

#### 6. Wrap-Up and Q&A (5 minutes)
**Summary:**
- Today, we learned about the internet, how websites work, and what we will be doing in this course.

**Questions:**
- Open the floor for any questions the students might have about the session or the course.

**Preview of Next Session:**
- In the next session, we will start setting up our coding environment and run our first "Hello World" HTML file.
