# üåü Session 14: JavaScript Basics - Variables and Actions! üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome back, young coders! Today, we're diving deeper into JavaScript to learn about variables, data types, and basic actions. These are the building blocks for creating more complex interactions and functionalities on your website. Ready to make your code more powerful? Let‚Äôs get started!

## üéØ **Learning Goals for Today**

By the end of this session, you will:
1. Understand what variables are and how to use them in JavaScript.
2. Learn about different data types and how to work with them.
3. Write simple JavaScript code to perform basic actions.

## üìñ **Introduction to JavaScript Basics**

### **What are Variables in JavaScript?**

Variables are like containers that store data values. You can use variables to hold numbers, text, or other types of information that your program needs to work with. They make your code more flexible and reusable.

### **Key Concepts of JavaScript Variables**

- **Declaration**: Creating a variable using keywords like `let`, `const`, or `var`.
- **Assignment**: Storing a value in a variable using the `=` operator.
- **Scope**: The area in which a variable is accessible (local or global).

### **Data Types in JavaScript**

JavaScript supports several types of data, including:

- **String**: Represents text. Example: `"Hello, World!"`
- **Number**: Represents numeric values. Example: `42`
- **Boolean**: Represents true or false values. Example: `true`
- **Array**: Represents a list of values. Example: `[1, 2, 3]`
- **Object**: Represents a collection of key-value pairs. Example: `{ name: "Alice", age: 25 }`

## üîç **Exploring JavaScript Variables and Actions**

### **1. Declaring and Using Variables**

- **Explanation**: You can declare a variable using `let` (for mutable variables) or `const` (for immutable variables).

- **Example**:

  ```html
  <script>
    let message = 'Welcome to JavaScript!';
    const pi = 3.14159;

    function displayMessage() {
      alert(message);
    }

    function showPi() {
      alert('The value of pi is: ' + pi);
    }
  </script>
  ```

### **2. Working with Different Data Types**

- **Explanation**: You can perform various operations with different data types, such as concatenating strings or performing arithmetic with numbers.

- **Example**:

  ```html
  <script>
    let name = 'Alice';
    let age = 12;
    let isStudent = true;

    function displayInfo() {
      alert('Name: ' + name + ', Age: ' + age + ', Student: ' + isStudent);
    }
  </script>
  ```

### **3. Using Arrays and Objects**

- **Explanation**: Arrays are used to store lists of items, and objects are used to store collections of key-value pairs.

- **Example**:

  ```html
  <script>
    let colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green'];
    let person = { name: 'Alice', age: 12 };

    function showFavoriteColor() {
      alert('Favorite color: ' + colors[1]); // 'blue'
    }

    function showPersonInfo() {
      alert('Name: ' + person.name + ', Age: ' + person.age);
    }
  </script>
  ```

## üíª **Interactive Coding Activity: JavaScript Variables and Actions**

### **1. Set Up Your Coding Environment**

1. Open a new HTML file in your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
2. Make sure your file has a basic HTML structure with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

### **2. Write Your JavaScript Code**

Follow these steps to create a simple JavaScript program:

1. **Step 1**: Declare variables and use them in functions:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>JavaScript Basics</title>
      <script>
        let greeting = 'Hello, ';
        let userName = 'Alice';
        let age = 15;

        function greetUser() {
          alert(greeting + userName + '!');
        }

        function showAge() {
          alert('You are ' + age + ' years old.');
        }
      </script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <button onclick="greetUser()">Greet User</button>
      <button onclick="showAge()">Show Age</button>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

2. **Save and Open Your File**:

    - Save your HTML file and open it in your web browser to see your JavaScript in action.

### **3. Experiment with Different Data Types**

Try creating your own variables with different data types and see how they interact with each other:

- **Challenge**: Create an array of your favorite fruits and a function that shows the first fruit in the array.

    ```html
    <script>
      let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

      function showFavoriteFruit() {
        alert('Favorite fruit: ' + fruits[0]); // 'apple'
      }
    </script>
    ```

## üìö **Interactive Quiz**

Let‚Äôs test your knowledge with a fun quiz! Answer the following questions to see how much you‚Äôve learned about JavaScript variables and actions.

1. **Which keyword is used to declare a variable that can be changed?**
    - a) `const`
    - b) `let`
    - c) `var`

2. **What type of data is represented by the value `true` or `false`?**
    - a) String
    - b) Number
    - c) Boolean

3. **How do you access the first element of an array in JavaScript?**
    - a) `array[0]`
    - b) `array[1]`
    - c) `array.first()`

### **Quiz Answers:**

1. b) `let` - This keyword allows you to declare variables that can be updated.
2. c) Boolean - This data type represents true or false values.
3. a) `array[0]` - Array indices start at 0, so the first element is accessed with `array[0]`.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Hands-On Project: Personal Information Dashboard**

In this project, you‚Äôll create a simple dashboard that displays personal information using JavaScript variables.

### **Project Steps:**

1. **Create a NEW HTML File:** Name it `dashboard.html`.
2. **Add Your Basic HTML Structure:**

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>Personal Dashboard</title>
      <script>
        let userName = 'Alice';
        let userAge = 15;
        let userHobbies = ['reading', 'coding', 'gaming'];

        function showDashboard() {
          alert('Name: ' + userName + '\nAge: ' + userAge + '\nHobbies: ' + userHobbies.join(', '));
        }
      </script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <button onclick="showDashboard()">Show My Dashboard</button>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

3. **Save and Preview:** Save your file and open it in a web browser to test your dashboard.

## ‚ú® **Wrap-Up and Homework**

You did an excellent job today! To reinforce what you've learned:

- **Homework:** Create a small JavaScript program that uses variables and functions to perform a task of your choice.
- **Additional Practice:** Explore different data types and try combining them in new ways.

## üöÄ **Fun Fact!**

Did you know that JavaScript was initially called "Mocha" and later renamed to "LiveScript" before finally becoming "JavaScript"? It‚Äôs come a long way since its early days!

Great work today! Keep experimenting and see you next time!

Happy Coding! üíª‚ú®
