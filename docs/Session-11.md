## Session 11: Styling Your Websites with CSS! ðŸŽ¨

### Lesson Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

*   Understand what CSS is and why it's important for web design
*   Explain the relationship between HTML and CSS
*   Use basic CSS selectors to target specific HTML elements
*   Apply simple CSS properties to change the appearance of text

### Materials Needed

*   Student computers with a text editor and web browser
*   Projector or large screen for demonstration
*   Optional: Printed handouts with key CSS concepts and examples

### Lesson Structure

**1. Introduction (5 minutes)**

*   Recap the previous session's focus on HTML structure.
*   Introduce CSS as the "styling language" for websites.
*   Use a simple analogy (like decorating a house or dressing up) to explain how CSS works with HTML.

**2. What is CSS? (10 minutes)**

*   Explain CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
*   Show examples of websites with and without CSS applied.
*   Discuss the benefits of CSS:
    *   Control over appearance (colors, fonts, layouts)
    *   Consistency across multiple web pages
    *   Easier maintenance of website design

**3. Basic CSS Syntax (15 minutes)**

*   Explain the structure of a CSS rule:
    *   Selector: The HTML element to be styled
    *   Declaration: Property and value pairs (e.g., `color: blue;`)
*   Demonstrate how to embed CSS directly in an HTML file using the `<style>` tag.
*   Introduce common CSS properties for text styling:
    *   `color`
    *   `font-family`
    *   `font-size`
    *   `font-weight`

**4. CSS Selectors (15 minutes)**

*   Explain that selectors tell CSS which elements to style.
*   Cover basic selector types:
    *   Element selectors (e.g., `p`, `h1`)
    *   ID selectors (e.g., `#myHeading`)
    *   Class selectors (e.g., `.myParagraph`)
*   Practice using selectors to style different parts of the sample website.

**5. Hands-on Practice (10 minutes)**

*   Have students open the "About Me" webpage they created in the previous module.
*   Guide them through adding a `<style>` tag and writing simple CSS rules to:
    *   Change the color and font of the page title
    *   Style the paragraph text
    *   (Optional) Create a class selector to style certain elements differently

**6. Wrap-up and Review (5 minutes)**

*   Summarize key concepts learned in the session.
*   Address any questions students have.
*   Preview the next session, where students will learn more advanced CSS techniques.

### Additional Tips

*   Use plenty of visual examples to demonstrate the impact of CSS.
*   Keep the lesson interactive with questions and quizzes.
*   Encourage experimentation and creativity with styling choices.
*   Relate CSS concepts to real-world examples (e.g., designing a poster, customizing a phone background).
