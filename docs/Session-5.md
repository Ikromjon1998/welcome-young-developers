# üåü Session 5: CSS - Dress Up Your Website! Part 1 üé®

Welcome back, young web designers! Today, we‚Äôre going to start exploring the colorful world of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS allows you to add style to your HTML elements, making your webpage look amazing. Let‚Äôs get started with the basics of CSS!

## üéØ **Learning Goals for Today**

By the end of this session, you will:
1. Understand what CSS is and why it‚Äôs important.
2. Learn how to apply basic styles to your HTML elements.
3. Practice styling text and backgrounds.

## üìñ **Introduction to CSS**

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It‚Äôs used to control the look and feel of your website. While HTML is used to structure your content, CSS is used to style it. Think of CSS as the clothing and accessories that make your webpage look stylish and unique.

### **Why is CSS Important?**

- **Design:** It allows you to change colors, fonts, layouts, and more.
- **Consistency:** It helps you maintain a consistent look across multiple pages.
- **Creativity:** It gives you the tools to be creative and make your website visually appealing.

## üîç **Basic CSS Syntax**

CSS is made up of **selectors** and **declarations**. 

- **Selector:** The HTML element you want to style.
- **Declaration:** How you want to style it (e.g., color, font-size).

**Syntax Example:**

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

- **Example:**

  ```css
  h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 24px;
  }
  ```

  This code styles all `<h1>` elements with blue text and a font size of 24 pixels.

## üíª **Interactive Coding Activity: Styling Your Webpage!**

### **1. Setting Up Your CSS File**

1. Open your coding editor.
2. Create a new file and save it as `styles.css`.

### **2. Linking CSS to HTML**

To apply CSS styles to your HTML file, you need to link the CSS file. Add the following line to the `<head>` section of your `index.html` file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

### **3. Writing Your First CSS Rules**

Let‚Äôs start by styling the text and background of your webpage. Open your `styles.css` file and add the following code:

```css
/* Style for the body of the webpage */
body {
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
  color: #333;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

/* Style for headings */
h1 {
  color: #4CAF50;
  text-align: center;
}

/* Style for paragraphs */
p {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}

/* Style for links */
a {
  color: #FF5722;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

### **4. Save and Preview**

1. Save both your `index.html` and `styles.css` files.
2. Open your `index.html` file in a web browser to see the new styles applied.

### **5. Experiment with Different Styles**
