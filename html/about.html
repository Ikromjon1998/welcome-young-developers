<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Ikrom. I'm 25 years old, and I love learning about web development!</p>

<p>I'm currently building my website as part of a course for young coders. I'm excited to learn more about HTML, CSS, and maybe even JavaScript in the future.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy Sleeping.</p>
